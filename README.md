# WordLadder
Implementing a word puzzle invented in the 19th century by Lewis Carroll. For this game, there is assigned a starting word and a target word (you can find more explanations in the pictures).

All the necessary details regarding the code are provided in the requirement pictures. 
For automatic mode, choose option 1 and for the playing mode choose option 2.

TO RUN THE PROJECT, create a project in a C++ IDE, I recommend Visual Studio Community or C Lion. Copy all the headers (.h) ,cpp (.cpp) files + english_words.txt and after that run the Source.cpp. 
I recommend you to use words NO LONGER THAN 4 words, as the performence of the program may decrease and you could get unexpected behaviour or errors.


AUTOMATIC MODE: option 1
PLAYER MODE: option 2
STOP: option 0
